## What I've learned & need to improve:

Having very limited time completing this weekend challenge I wanted to focus on interacting with the return key values from the given API.
I was unsure on how to write tests in this context and tried to TDD with good planning and sudo code instead
Keen on implementig more userstories in the coming days

## Implementation

Functional representation of user requirements:
