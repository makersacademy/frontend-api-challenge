# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

This is a small Twitter clone that allows users to post messages to a public stream. The backend API is already provided and hosted on Heroku. The task is to build a front-end single-page application (SPA) to interface with the API.

## Ruby Version

If you're interested in an alternative implementation of this project using Ruby, you can check out the [Ruby version](https://github.com/Shakhrai8/cyber-twitter).

The Ruby version includes both the backend and frontend components, and utilizes a database for data storage. It provides similar features to the JavaScript version, allowing users to create accounts, post peeps, view and delete peeps, and more. Feel free to explore and compare the two implementations.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

- Creating users
- Logging in
- Posting peeps
- Viewing all peeps
- Viewing individual peeps
- Deleting peeps
- Liking peeps
- Unliking peeps

## Technologies Used

The application has been developed using the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- Jest (for testing)
- HTML
- CSS
- Apis

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Shakhrai8/frontend-api-challenge.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd frontend-api-challenge`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the application: `npm run build`
5. Open the application: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

## Usage

6. **Deleting Peeps**: If you are the owner of a peep, a delete button will be displayed when viewing the peep details. Click the delete button to remove the peep.
7. **Liking Peeps**: When viewing the details of a peep, click the "Like" button to like the peep.
8. **Unliking Peeps**: If you have already liked a peep, the "Like" button will be changed to "Unlike". Click the "Unlike" button to remove your like from the peep.
